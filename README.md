- Make sure there's a GPU performance test
- Add CUDA support, via ephemerals
- Optimize it to be as fast as possible

- Make sure that I can include it into another Rez package
    - Get .h included as a separate folder (so it can be importable)

- Add environment variable for the maximum, smallest value


- Make sure passing just a list / set / container / etc to the function is valid
